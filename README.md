## XprobePlugin - app memory browser

![Icon](http://injectionforxcode.johnholdsworth.com/xprobe.png)

The XprobePlugin is an Xcode extension that allows you to browse memory as you would a web site.
Build the project and restart Xcode to get up and running. In the simulator, no changes to your 
project are required. Simply use the Product/Xprobe/Load menu item to load the memory scanner into
a running application and click on links to reveal detail about the objects listed. The list of 
objects can be refreshed and filtered at any time using the search field on the upper wiew.
Simple values can be clicked on to edit them and the value for properties and methods with 
no arguments can be retrieved by clicking on them.

More documentation to follow once I've got the repository up and running.
